Learning Node.js (Intermediate) â€” Packages, Modularity &amp; Express

Hey everyone, thanks for coming to my talk today! Sorry to the folks that wanted more advanced discussion on node.js -- I hope the live coding was able to balance some of that out.

If anyone has any questions, short or long, send them my way and/or create an "issue" on this repo.

Happy coding everyone!
